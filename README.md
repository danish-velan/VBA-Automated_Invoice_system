# VBA-Automated_Invoice_system (VBA Project)
Data Tracking:
📋 The updateTracker subroutine copies data from the "Billing Statement" sheet to the "Billing Tracker" sheet for record-keeping.

Data Clearing and Invoice Number Management:
🔄 The clearData subroutine automates resetting key fields after an invoice is generated. It updates the invoice number 🔢, sets the current date 📅, and clears input fields for a fresh start.

PDF Export:
📄 The convert_pdf subroutine generates a PDF of the billing statement, assigning a unique name 🔐 using random codes to avoid duplicates. A confirmation message ✅ notifies the user of successful PDF creation.

Automation Workflow:
⚙️ The updateAll subroutine combines all functionalities into a single automated workflow, ensuring efficient and error-free invoice generation.

This project is perfect for businesses seeking a simple, effective way to automate invoices, minimize manual tasks, and maintain accurate records. 💼✨
